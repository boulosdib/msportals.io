## Special Notes ##

On some of the portals, we have been adding notes. For example

Example: Using the notes to make old product name searchable for Defender products.
![Defender for Endpoint is shown with "previously Defender ATP"](https://i.imgur.com/t8by69w.png)

Example: The new versus old Exchange Portals shown below.
